# deep-learning-challenge

## Overview
This challenge utilises machine learning method and neural networks to make a model that could give best results for predictions
The dataset used to make model prediction is provided in CSV file that contains funding information from more than 34000 organisations. 
Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit organisation needs a good model which could be used to select successful applications to receive the fundings.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

1. The variable(s) for the target(s) of the model
   - "IS_SUCCESSFUL"
2. The variable(s) for the features of the model
   -  "APPLICATION_TYPE"
   -  "AFFILIATION",
   -  "CLASSIFICATION",
   -  "USE_CASE",
   -  "ORGANIZATION",
   - "STATUS",
   - "INCOME_AMT",
   - "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS",
   -  "ASK_AMT"
3. The variables(s) that should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features
   - "EIN"
   - "NAME"

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
1. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions are selected for the neural network model
   - Neurons:
   - Layers:
   - Activation functions:

2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
   -Unfortunately,No. Model accuracy is below 75%

3. What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
   - Adding optimum layers to 3
   -
